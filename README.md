# EQNexus Manifest File Repository

This is where EQ Requiem stores its custom server files and creates its manifest for [EQ Nexus](https://github.com/knervous/requiemfiles)

For any server operators wishing to opt in to EQ Nexus, fork this repo and add your own files. Every push to master will trigger a new release of `manifest.json`.

You can create a PR into the EQ Nexus repo above with your server name and link to the manifest, e.g. `https://github.com/{github_name}/{github_repo}/releases/latest/download/manifest.json`

Feel free to communicate via GitHub or EQEmu Discord.
